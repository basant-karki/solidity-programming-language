   - The keyword contract is used to define a new smart contract in Solidity. In this case, the contract is named helloworld.

   - The contract helloworld has a single state variable called firstoutput, which is declared as a string type. State variables are persistent variables that store data in the contract's storage.

   - The keyword public makes the firstoutput variable accessible from outside the contract. It creates an automatic getter function that allows other contracts or users to read the value of firstoutput.

   - The initial value of firstoutput is set to the string "Helloworld".

In summary, this smart contract defines a public string variable firstoutput with the initial value "Helloworld". It can be used to store and retrieve the string value "Helloworld" on the blockchain. Other contracts or users can access this value through the automatically generated getter function.
